# Actions on Google: Webhook Boilerplate

Boilerplate to help you get started quickly with the Java client library for Actions on Google.

:warning: This code sample was built using Dialogflow. We now recommend using [Actions Builder or the Actions SDK](https://developers.google.com/assistant/conversational/overview) to develop, test, and deploy Conversational Actions.

### Setup Instructions

#### Action Configuration
1. From the [Actions on Google Console](https://console.actions.google.com/), New project (this will become your *Project ID*) > **Create Project**.
1. Scroll down to the **More Options** section, and click on the **Conversational** card.
1. From the top menu under **Develop** > **Actions** (left nav) > **Add your first action** > **BUILD** (this will bring you to the Dialogflow console) > Select language and time zone > **CREATE**.
1. In Dialogflow, go to **Settings** ⚙ > **Export and Import** > **Restore from zip**.
    + Follow the directions to restore from the `agent.zip` file in this repo.

#### App Engine Deployment & Webhook Configuration
When a new project is created using the Actions Console, it also creates a Google Cloud project in the background.
1. Delete ActionsAWSHandler.java
1. Remove the following line from build.gradle:
     + `apply from: 'build-aws.gradle'`
1. Download & install the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/)
1. Configure the gcloud CLI and set your Google Cloud project to the name of your Actions on Google Project ID, which you can find from the [Actions on Google console](https://console.actions.google.com/) under Settings ⚙
    + `gcloud init`
    + `gcloud auth application-default login`
    + `gcloud components install app-engine-java`
    + `gcloud components update`
1. Deploy to [App Engine using Gradle](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/java/using-gradle):
    + `gradle appengineDeploy` OR
    +  From within IntelliJ, open the Gradle tray and run the appEngineDeploy task.
1. Back in the [Dialogflow console](https://console.dialogflow.com), from the left navigation menu under **Fulfillment** > **Enable Webhook**, set the value of **URL** to `https://<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>.appspot.com` > **Save**.

#### Build for AWS
1. Delete ActionsServlet
1. Remove the following line from build.gradle:
    + `apply from: 'build-gcp.gradle'`
1. Build the AWS Lambda compatible zip file using the buildAWSZip gradle task: `gradle buildAWSZip`
1. Deploy the zip file found at `build/distributions/myactions.zip` as an AWS Lambda function by following instructions at https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/

#### Testing this Sample
+ In the [Dialogflow console](https://console.dialogflow.com), from the left navigation menu > **Integrations** > **Integration Settings** under Google Assistant > Enable **Auto-preview changes** >  **Test** to open the Actions on Google simulator. **OR**
+ Type `Talk to my test app` in the simulator, or say `OK Google, talk to my test app` to Google Assistant on a mobile device associated with your Action's account.
